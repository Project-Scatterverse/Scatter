# Basically, my version of Charter (which is not done yet).

## Features:
- permakill items
- revive items (if you desire)
- ghosts (which can control mobs)
- idk, suggest something in [Discord](https://discord.gg/egN2MaYQZu) if you want

## Usage:
- /scatter 0-3 with item in main hand, where
- 0 - Reset
- 1 - scatter (permakill)
- 2 - reviver
- 3 - both scatter and reviver

### Currently only for 1.18, but if you want a port/backport, go ahead and request it in [Discord](https://discord.gg/egN2MaYQZu)
