# Scatter

## Overview
Basically, my version of [**Charter**](https://modrinth.com/mod/Charter) _(which is not done yet)_.

This plugin features **permakilling*** any player _(e.g., scattering)_, effectively turning them into a **ghost** using one single item.

# Scattering
After you obtain a **scatter** item, you can **permanently*** kill any player _(unless someone revives them)_. After you kill them normally with a **scatter** item, they will be **trapped**.

# Trapped state
In the **trapped** state player can't move or deal damage, waiting for your **decision**.

If you decide to **spare** them, just hit them with your empty hand.

But if you decide **otherwise**, finish them off in 3 hits.

Be aware, these **chains** can't hold for long!

# Ghosts
Whenever a player gets scattered, they are turned into a ghost.

**Ghosts** can't do anything other than **watch** or **control** some basic mobs, no breaking or placing blocks, no sprinting, dealing damage, or even flying and nocliping.

To **control** a mob while being a **ghost**, **right-click** the mob, and **shift** if you want to leave it be.

# Soul
**Souls** appear whenever a player is **scattered**. **Green particles** indicate that the player is on the server, or at least a **ghost** of them.

If you want, you can even make a **memorial** at the soul's location.

# Reviving
If you want to **revive** a player, make sure they are on the server and drop the **reviver** near the soul. They will be teleported back to the soul's location.

# Obtaining the items
To obtain **scatter** or **reviver**, you need to be **OP** and use the /scatter command, while holding an item in your main hand.

In the future, I will make another way to obtain it.

## Commands:
**/scatter**, holding item in main hand to make scatter
**/reviver**, holding item in main hand to make reviver
**/state <player> regular/tagged/trapped/ghost/meowthpiece**, to change state of a player

## Technical stuff
**Scatter** item can be anything: armor, weapons, and offhand items.

## Currently only for 1.21.x
